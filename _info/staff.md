  <h3> Peter Master (TA)</h3>
    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Peter Master and I'm a 4th year Computer Science BS/MS student from Walnut Creek, California. I had almost no coding experience before college, but I was inspired by the problem solving and interesting concepts that programming involved and the unmatched power to create and create at scale with little overhead that programming offers. I've interned at Google in Mountain View and a couple local start-ups, and I'm working on developing a sequential proof of work algorithm. I took a gap year to pursue technical-based financial market trading full time. I'm involved with the technology management program at UCSB, and I enjoy reading books and blogs about cognitive biases, risk, gamification, product, and best practices. I also enjoy weightlifting, writing, fasting, Chess, PC games, and playing tennis, basketball, and soccer. I'm looking forward to working with you all as a TA and hope that you can find some enjoyment, interest, and maybe even inspiration in the material as I did."</i>

  <h3> Diego Segundo (Tutor)</h3>
    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Diego Segundo and I’m a 4th year computer science major originally from Huntington Beach California. I first was introduced to coding in high school and was drawn towards the creative aspect of coding and how there are so many different ways to solve one problem. For the last couple years I have worked as a web developer at the Daily Nexus (which is a school newspaper here at ucsb). I originally started mentoring in the spring of last year, and think that it is a great program that provides undergraduates with an extra opportunity to help them understand the course material. So far I have mentored for CS8 and CS56 (both for Professor Conrad). Outside of school my hobbies include playing basketball and surfing. This is my first quarter mentoring for cs16 and I am really looking forward to it!" </i>

I'm excited to meet you all this winter quarter and help to further your programming skills. C++ might seem a little daunting at first, but don't let this stop you; I'm here to help you excel in the course, so ask away! In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, taking walks around campus, making terrible jokes (ask at your own expense!), and playing ping pong at the Santa Rosa Residence Hall. :)  " </i>

It's glad to see you in CS 16, and I will be here to help you in any way I can so you can master the material and expand your skills in coding :D I love answering questions, so if you have anything, from pointer diagrams, CS major progression, or how to install Android 9.0 on your Samsung S4, I'll be glad to answer everything. For hobbies, I used to shoot skeet competitively, and I still play RTS games that are older than I am." </i>
