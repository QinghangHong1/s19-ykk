  <h3> Diego Segundo (Tutor)</h3>
    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Diego Segundo and I’m a 4th year computer science major originally from Huntington Beach California. I first was introduced to coding in high school and was drawn towards the creative aspect of coding and how there are so many different ways to solve one problem. For the last couple years I have worked as a web developer at the Daily Nexus (which is a school newspaper here at ucsb). I originally started mentoring in the spring of last year, and think that it is a great program that provides undergraduates with an extra opportunity to help them understand the course material. So far I have mentored for CS8 and CS56 (both for Professor Conrad). Outside of school my hobbies include playing basketball and surfing. This is my first quarter mentoring for cs16 and I am really looking forward to it!" </i>

  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Surya and I'm a first-year CE major. My gender pronouns are he, his and him. I'm excited to meet you all this winter quarter and help to further your programming skills. C++ might seem a little daunting at first, but don't let this stop you; I'm here to help you excel in the course, so ask away! In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, taking walks around campus, making terrible jokes (ask at your own expense!), and playing ping pong at the Santa Rosa Residence Hall. :)  " </i>

I started my freshman year as a math major and eventually switched into Computer Science. Feel free to ask me questions about major switching if you are considering it.  I am interested in web development and machine learning outside of class. I am part of programming group working on a WeChat MiniProgram at CSA (Chinese Student Association).
